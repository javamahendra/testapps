Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application framework developed by Google. It's a comprehensive framework that allows developers to build dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs) with a rich user interface. Here are some key aspects and concepts related to Angular:

1. Architecture:
Angular follows the component-based architecture. Applications are built using components, which are reusable, modular pieces of code that encapsulate the logic, structure, and styling of a part of the user interface.
2. Components:
Components are the building blocks of Angular applications. They consist of a TypeScript class with a decorator, an HTML template, and optional CSS styles. Components are organized in a hierarchical structure.
3. Templates:
HTML templates define the structure of the user interface for a component. Angular uses a two-way data binding system, allowing changes in the UI to automatically update the underlying data and vice versa.
4. Directives:
Directives are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to attach a specific behavior to that element. Examples include ngIf for conditionally rendering elements and ngFor for rendering lists.
5. Services:
Services are used for encapsulating and organizing business logic, data manipulation, or communication with external services. They are typically singleton instances shared across the application.
6. Dependency Injection:
Angular has a built-in dependency injection system that helps manage the creation and injection of objects (services, components, etc.) into other objects.
7. Modules:
Modules help organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They are used to group related components, directives, pipes, and services.
8. Routing:
Angular provides a powerful router for building single-page applications with navigation. It allows for lazy loading of modules and defining routes for different components.
9. Forms:
Angular offers a comprehensive form handling mechanism with two-way data binding, form validation, and support for both template-driven forms and reactive forms.
